title: Aion and Solidity
---

When Aion first started out, the network was based upon the Fast Virtual Machine (FVM). This was a modified implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Because of this, much of the Aion ecosystem was based upon Ethereum and Solidity. Aion have since moved onto the Aion Virtual Machine (AVM), a blockchain virtual machine using the robust Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

This section is intended to be a holding location for all the information regarding Aion and Solidity. This section will not be frequently updated, outside of errors and bug fixes.
