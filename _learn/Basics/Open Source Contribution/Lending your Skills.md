The reality is, not all community members have a deep knowledge of the problems we face, and how to help. That is one of the reason why we've created this and if you have additional suggestions, feel free to [get in touch with us](https://aionnetwork.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/9)."

We all have one common language here and it's blockchain! Be apart of the movement on making blockchain more accessible to the world. Can you help us translate? In the following weeks, we will be formalizing a process so that talented multilingual people like you can take part of this global revolution. We're interested in starting off with these languages - Chinese, Russian, Japanese, Korean. Shoot us an e-mail if you're interested and we'll let you know when we're open for translation contributions!

Building decentralized applications and using existing decentralized infrastructure is still admittedly high friction. An important pillar in lowering the barriers to development adoption is an approachable language layer that helps developers, miners, users and other contributors get started. Since experience is the greatest teacher, we think it’s important that this language layer is a collaboration by a community of enthusiasts all over the world. This is where you come in.

If you've been following Aion and developments in the blockchain space, you can likely make meaningful contributions. In an effort to make it easier to engage with the project we’ve started a content channel aimed at teaching developers, miners, and users everything from getting started to more advanced topics like contributing to the kernel.
