# Incentive Program 

**Overview**
The incentive program's core mandate is to accelerate the growth of the Aion ecosystem through the community. As of today, the Incentive Program is comprised of grants and bounties, which are important tasks or projects we ask that the community take on. As an open-source foundation that is committed to decentralization, transparency is a core pillar of this program.

We hold ourselves accountable for how we operate our funds and ensure a fair and open process for the community. Below you will find details on how we make decisions, our core principles, and guidelines for you to follow to make the process as seamless as possible. We are continuously improving this program with the goal of increasing the adoption of Aion through multiple facets of the community. 

This table helps illustrate the differences between grants and bounties.

## Grants 

Grants are equity free funds dispersed to individuals or entities for a specified or proposed purpose. Grant applications will be evaluated based on the benefit to the Aion ecosystem, financial & technical feasibility, team track-record and contributions to Aion, and the practicality of timelines & milestones.

**Applicant Expectations** 

The mission of the incentive program is to fund projects and initiatives that will grow a healthy open-source community that focuses on mainstream adoption. Here are some of the key principles we look for:
- Directly benefit the Aion ecosystem and broader community as a whole
- Co-create on projects that help unblock developers building dApps 
- Promote open-source 
- Collaborate with other projects within the community
- Have a path to sustainability 


**We will NOT fund:
**
- Projects that benefit a single entity and not the ecosystem as a whole
- ICOs 
- Applications that have a significant profit margin baked into their cost 
- Projects that do not have a clear purpose 
- Projects that do not have clear ownership and post-grant sustainability strategy 


**This is what a successful application looks like:
** 
- Aligned with Aion's vision and roadmap
- Budgeted at a reasonable cost with a justified timeline
- Tangible milestones and deliverables 
- Well-articulated support and sustainability plans
- Well equipped to deliver 


## Bounties 

Bounties are a form of recognition and compensation offered to individuals who complete a task. They include bugs, security vulnerabilities, documentation, translations, features, test coverage and more.

*You will be notified of your application status at each of the steps described above.*

**Types of Bounties**

Bounties are released on an ongoing basis spanning technical  and non-technical 
tasks. Bounties fall under but are not limited to the following categories:
  * New features
  * Documentation
  * Bug hunting
  * Translations
  * Research (both technical and non-technical)
  * Test Coverage 
  * Miscellaneous 

****Bounties are divided into two tiers:****
  * **Tier 1 bounties**: tasks that are open for everyone to claim. These are typically short (<1 week) and require beginner to intermediate skills.
  * **Tier 2 bounties**: tasks that only proven bounty hunters on Aion can claim. These are typically longer (1+ weeks) with a higher degree of complexity and criticality. They also come with a larger reward.

## Future Incentives 

We will be releasing additional forms of incentives shortly. Stay tuned!
