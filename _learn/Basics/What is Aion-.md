title: "What is Aion?"
excerpt: "Not only a blockchain network, but a powerful smart contract platform."
---
Aion is a distributed smart contract platform designed to help developers build a new generation of applications with unique attributes such as end-user privacy preservation, crypto-currency based business models, censorship resistance and verifiable payments without the need for an intermediary. In simple terms, Aion is a blockchain but unlike the Bitcoin blockchain it has a virtual machine that allows it to execute smart contracts.

}
[/block]
The Aion smart contract platform works by running a network of machines worldwide that act as a distributed database called a ledger, to which developers can deploy applications called smart contracts. The logic in these smart contracts trigger outcomes that are verifiably true, making them an important piece of infrastructure for modern applications.

Aion aims to solve many of the big issues persistent with blockchain technology. These include in no specific order:

Opening the true potential of smart contracts, Aion has decided to go into the direction of releasing the Aion Virtual Machine (based on the JVM). Aion now supports Java smart contracts which makes it easy to:
* Write robust code due to the ability to construct complex user-defined types 
* Combined with the compiler (embedded [AVM](https://docs.aion.network/docs/aion-virtual-machine)) immediately verifying contracts
* IDEs being able to provide code completion and debugging processes

This doesn’t even begin to tap into the treasure trove of open source tools which have grown around the Java ecosystem, many of which can be applied to this environment to improve quality and velocity. 

Quality strengths of the [AVM](https://docs.aion.network/docs/aion-virtual-machine):
* **Performance**: The AVM uses the JIT compiler which optimizes the DApp code. It also features multi-threading, allowing increased throughput via concurrent transaction execution as opposed to most blockchain VMs
* **Reliability & Maturity**: The AVM uses the JIT compiler which optimizes the DApp code. It also features multi-threading, allowing increased throughput via concurrent transaction execution as opposed to most blockchain VMs.
* **Developer Friendly:** The Java-based AVM leverages the entire Java tooling ecosystem, making developer onboarding and experience extremely streamlined. You get the full developer package including the compiler and IDE straight out of the box! That said, the AVM taps into a well-established community that has claimed the top spot for the #1 language (Java) in the past few years.
