Mining is a term used to describe thousands of participating agents all over the world contributing computational power from their computers or "[mining rigs](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining_rig)" and sending it to the Aion Network in exchange for a reward in the form of [AION](doc:what-is-the-aion-coin). It is this computational power that sends transactions through the network and keeps it secure, decentralized and immutable.

### Pros

-	Mining equipment provides multiple functionalities
-	Learn a ton about the mechanics of a blockchain, open source projects, hardware and entrepreneurship.
-	Separate your time from your money, in that currently most people make a living from salaries and wages. Mining is a passive investment that earns while you sleep.
-	Make money. During “crypto winters” making money can be a challenge. But in a bull run market, miners could be making out like bandits, some clearing [$500 per day.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmkwAjuLJgw)
-	Support a project you believe in.
-	Earn more AION over the lifetime of your equipment than if you just bought it upfront.
-       Help keep the network decentralized and distributed.

###Cons

* Sometimes your rigs will run and use electricity but they won’t be mining due to either failure of mining pool or node.
* Only 1 block will be submitted in a day, and it may be rejected since another miner's block propagated through the network faster.
* Miners can be noisy and hot.
* You are unlikely be able to do it alone. You will probably join an Aion mining pool.

We've set up a [mining section](https://docs.aion.network/docs/aion-mining-overview) in these docs that walks you through how you can participate as an individual miner, or as a contributor to a group of miners called a pool (a simpler option to get started but often requires a small fee).

There are a various mining software you can use:

###[EWBF Miner](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4466962.0)
The EWBF miner runs an Equihash algorithm that supports mining AION Coin. It can be used for  mining on a Windows or Linux machine. By default, the fee is set to 2%.

###[Solo and Public Pools](https://docs.aion.network/docs/aion-mining-overview)
You can also join a public pool or solo mine. There are public mining pool instructions on our forum [here](https://forum.aion.network/t/aion-community-mining-guides/782/39), or you can get started solo mining [here](doc:solo-mining-pool).
