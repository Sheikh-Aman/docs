AION is a cryptographic currency used to power the Aion Network. It is a currency because its market value changes according to market forces of demand and supply. It is a new form of asset class the world has not seen before and as a result, there is a lot of misinformation about it. This article sets out to define what the coin is, why it exists and what the world will look like with it in the hands of everyday consumer

The AION Coin has four main purposes:
1. Main chain operations. Staking AION to participate in the consensus mechanism, executing transactions, and paying for transaction fees on the Aion network.

2. Using the token to access computer resources on a distributed virtual machine. (Similar to Ethereum)

3. Creating interchain bridges. AION will be required to bridge two blockchains and perform interchain transactions. Also known as Federate.

4. Create customized blockchains interoperable with others. You will be able to choose if its public or private, the consensus mechanism and issuance. Also known as *Spoke*.

We've written an advanced section that outlines how the coin is used by multiple different groups - some to power the network, others to put transactions through the network, some to facilitate cross blockchain functionality, and others still to watch the coin appreciate in value over time. You can read more about that [here](doc:what-can-i-do-with-my-aion-coins).
