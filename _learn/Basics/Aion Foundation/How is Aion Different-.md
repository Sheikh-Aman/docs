There are many blockchains that focus on specific features like privacy, scalability, security, speed, cost and more. As a developer building a decentralized application you must choose one of these “purpose-built blockchains” for your business use case, often sacrificing one value at the expense of gaining another (for example, speed vs security).

<<glossary:Aion>>  is a stand-alone blockchain network for developers that wish to:

1. Avoid “vendor lock-in" that ties the destiny of their application to a single blockchain network.

2. Borrow features specific to purpose-built blockchains by acting as a hub that connects all blockchains to one another, commonly referred to as "blockchain interoperability".
