  "body": "Technology roadmaps have a long history of movement away from longer-term (waterfall) planning, towards shorter, more **[\"agile\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)** planning methodologies. While the broader blockchain ecosystem has opted for long-term milestone promises, we have embraced leaner, market responsive development planning. As a result, this section outlines some high-level goals but not a granular breakdown on dates."

Below is a roadmap breakdown for the core offering of the [Aion Foundation](doc:how-is-the-aion-foundation-governed). While it acts as a general guide for what is coming, there are an increasing number of tools and services building value around this core architecture that we have highlighted in the [Aion Master Tool List](doc:the-aion-master-tool-list). 

**Phase 1: Kilimanjaro**
