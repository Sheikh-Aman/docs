excerpt: "The Aion network monetary policy differs from other networks in a few ways, most notably in that we face challenges associated with interoperability across blockchains. Learn more about that policy here."

Traditional monetary policies have been implemented and operated by central banks within the ranks of government. It is typically managed by a group or committee that determine the size and rate of growth of the money supply (the total pie) of a currency. Since blockchain often incorporate a digital asset and must manage the size and rate of growth of the currency without a centralized authority, they implement programmatic Monetary Policies.

When evaluating a Monetary Policy there are some simple heuristics for evaluating the behavior and potential outcomes of its implementation. For example:

**Supply:** How is the money supply determined?

**Placement:** How is money injected into the system?

**Custodians:** Who watches over the average joes in the system?

**Transactions:** How is money transacted? Who bears the cost?

**Beneficiaries:** Where are the benefits accrued in the system?

The Aion Kilimanjaro release was launched on April 25th, 2018. Participants of the consensus process validating the network are known as miners, and are rewarded according to a fixed inflationary model. The reward structure is designed to achieve the economic needs of the long-term network while providing enough incentive to promote network utilization as it grows.

### Mining Rewards

Miner rewards in the **[Aion Kilimanjaro release](doc:what-does-the-aion-roapmap-look-like)** are calculated based on a **1% annual inflation** of the total <<glossary:AION Coin>>  supply. This results in an inflationary mining reward of ~4.56M AlON in the first year. This inflationary model rewards mining participants through new coins while addressing annual coin loss (key loss, lockup, etc). When the hybrid consensus network is launched (Aion-Everest), the inflationary reward model will support the incentive structure for broad participation in the active backing of miners.

This results in daily rewards of 12,942.627 AION in the first year (Post-ramp-up period). Mining rewards are in the form of the native AION Coin, and are calculated based on a 10 second block time.

### The Future
Rewards should be proportional to the utility of the network. Thus, we want to promote the stability of existing networks while rewarding the adoption of Aion blockchains. AION Coins will be free-flowing across native Aion blockchains, and the mechanism by which these reward incentives are calculated is currently being researched.
