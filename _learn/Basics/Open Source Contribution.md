AION Coin holders are owners of a critical piece of the network. AION is an asset used to incentivize miners to power the network, by senders to request their transaction be included in a block, by developers in their smart contracts and in the near future - by bridge operators to power multi-chain events and asset transfer.

Mining helps to secure and validate transactions on the Aion Network. Put your graphics cards to use and be rewarded with <<glossary:AION coins>> every time you successfully mine a block and add it to the blockchain.

There are a few ways to get started, but beware that mining is like a very fun and addictive game. Read more on mining at [Mining the Aion Network](doc:mining-the-aion-network)
