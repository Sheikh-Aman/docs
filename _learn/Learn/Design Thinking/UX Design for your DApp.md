title: "UX Design for your DApp"

Blockchain technology is revolutionizing the world as we know it today and influencing the coming a new, decentralized era. So why hasn't it become widely adopted among users? Well, currently the user experience (UX) design of blockchain products â€“ decentralized applications (DApps as we call them),  are still far from perfect amongst the blockchain space. This ultimately acts as a barrier when it comes to adopting the technology. As blockchain and decentralized technology progresses and continues to reveal the true power of the new web (web 3.0), great UX designs are part onboarding users which will ultimately be followed by adoption.

## Good UX = Good Business and ROI
UX design is about going through certain processes to make a product usable, easy to use and delightful to interact with. Good UX brings good business outcomes and ROI for your application and/or organization. It helps you to gain the empathy for your target users, clarify which design direction would work best, reduce the amount of lost efforts, and increases the speed-to-market.

## Mass adoption in a variety of industries 
Blockchain technology is a very capable of transforming the way people live and work in their daily life - changing standards for identity, financial assets, and governance. Great user experience design is one of the keys to unlocking the door for mass blockchain technology adoption. UX design that seamlessly combines blockchain and industry workflow opens more opportunities for enterprises to leverage the blockchain technology without having to completely understand the technology. Easy-to-use user interface would allow more non-technical and newbie users to enter into the space and improve your blockchain use case.   

## More innovative ideas 
Delightful user experiences and intuitive user interfaces that enable decentralization can bring more innovative ideas. As we know, there are unlimited possibilities to utilize blockchain with decentralization, immutability, and transparency, etc. There is no doubt that UX design would consolidate these powerful properties and wrap the technology into a neat, real applicable product. We can collect and study the feedback from the dApps created, looking at how users behave with the application, then apply the newfound insight for future innovation and improvements.

Design thinking is an effective approach for solving problems for UX design. Steps to follow are:
* Empathize: Take different approaches to gain a more of an empathetic understanding of your users
* Define: Define pain points of users, the core problems that need to be solved
* Ideate: Brainstorm and generate ideas amongst your team 
* Prototype: Test out certain designs and have potential users go through a flow and analyze their behaviour (what went well, any frustrations, confusion)

## Make users the focal point
Currently, the blockchain space is more developer-centric; people are focused more on how to deploy smart contracts and how to constantly improve the underlying technology itself. Although understandable, as it follows the initial stages of any new tech, there is lots of pressure for mass adoption and a breakthrough product. However, successful products come from companies who can relate to their users and solve their problems in an intuitive, accessible way. 

### Identify Different User Personas
Personas are archetypal users who represent certain target audience of your application. They should be based on qualitative and quantitative user research, backed by web behavior and analytics. Personas help you to gain the understanding and empathy of what the user needs, their motives, and their pain points. By being able to identify their personality, you can tailor your application to fit the needs of your user while solving their problems, and not guess what is best.

**Technical vs Non-technical Users**
 * Technical users are people who are blockchain savvy or come from a technical background and may have an idea of blockchain technology itself. In most of cases, they have more desire and capability to learn, which makes it easier to empathize with them.  
 * However, in the real word, the majority fall under non-technical users who haven't heard of blockchain before. Thus, it is essential to have an easy on boarding, and easy-to-use experience so that the transition and usability aspects are simple for these type of users.   
**Consumer vs Enterprise user **
* Consumers are individuals who uses applications for personal, and may not even realize or care that the app is decentralized. For them, as long as it works, convenient, and easy to use - they will be content. 
* Enterprise users are corporate users who would utilize the application in a professional manner. This can include customized solutions on certain use cases or to improve and achieve certain business goals. Enterprises themselves can leverage blockchain technology to target complex cases that pertain to data integrity, interoperability, and transparency.
