In blockchain, tokens are a combination of value representation and/or access to rights. This broad scope makes it non-trivial for determining how you should design your token, however, we're here to help. In order to identify the desired characteristics of your token, we will walk through four considerations.
[block:api-header]
{
  "title": "1. Technical Considerations"
}
[/block]
How are your tokens technically derived? We've seen two types of tokens from a technical perspective Protocol Tokens and App tokens. 

[block:api-header]
{
  "title": "Protocol Tokens"
}
[/block]
These are part of the incentive mechanism that allow a decentralized protocol like <<glossary:Aion>> function. They act as a block validator incentive (miner rewards) and in transaction spam prevention.

{
  "title": "App Tokens"
}
[/block]
These are tokens that are issued on the application layer with a few lines of code through a [smart contract](doc:what-is-a-smart-contract). Many are based on pre-defined token standards like Ethereum's ERC-20 or Aion's [ATS](https://github.com/aionnetwork/AIP/issues/4). They can represent:
  * physical goods
  * digital goods
  * right to perform an action in a network
  * right to perform an action in the real world

  "title": "2. Rights Considerations"
}
[/block]
What type of rights are attached to your token? Your token may have a hybrid of these classifications but there are some clear conceptual buckets.
[block:api-header]
{
  "title": "Store of Value (Passive Token)"
}
[/block]
Right to an underlying economic value.
  * *Security Tokens:* representing shares of a business
  * *Asset-backed Tokens:* real-world assets represented as tokens to be transferred and traded in a trustless environment.
  * *Currency Tokens:* representative of an amount of a currency. As an example, **a Bitcoin** represents **1BTC** worth of value.
[block:api-header]
{
  "title": "Access or Activity Rights (Active Token)"
}
[/block]
The token is required to participate in a network that no centralized party controls. In this classification we have 
  * *Usage Tokens:* right to use network services.
  * *Work Tokens:* right to produce value within a network.
  * *Reputation/Reward Tokens:* Privileged right to do something within a network.

  "title": "3. Fungibility Considerations"
}
[/block]
What type of properties does your token hold? 
[block:api-header]
{
  "title": "Fungible Tokens"
}
[/block]
  * Only quantity matters, units of fungible assets of the same kind are indistinguishable.
  * Any amount can be merged or divided into a larger or smaller amount of it making it indistinguishable from the rest.
[block:api-header]
{
  "title": "Non-Fungible Tokens"
}
[/block]
  * Unique and can be distinguished from each other
  * Have varying properties
  * Everyone knows how many there are

{
  "title": "4. Legal Considerations"
}
[/block]
*Disclaimer: We are not advising on legal matters when it comes to tokens. Please hire professional lawyers when it comes to legal opinion.*
How will the token be regulated? International regulators are still trying to understand and classify different token types. Here is the current state of affairs:

Currencies: Regulated by financial market authorities.
Securities: no physical asset, just contracts, fall under securities law:
  * equity tokens
  * convertible bonds
  * debenture tokens
  * option tokens
  * smart contract features
  * bond token
  * smart swap contracts

Utility Tokens: Still unknown.
