In the previous guide, we walked you through [design considerations](doc:when-should-i-use-a-digital-asset) and characteristics of your digital asset or token. This guide is aimed at helping you understand your tokens functionality in relation to other real-world examples.

{
  "title": "Active vs Passive Token Examples"
}
[/block]
In the guide on designing your token, we looked at "rights considerations" and whether your token was a store of value (passive) or if your token gave the holder access to perform an activity (active). Below are some examples of these tokens. 
[block:parameters]
{
  "data": {
    "0-0": "Transferable",
    "1-0": "non-transferable",
    "h-1": "Fixed (Active)",
    "h-2": "Unlimited (active)",
    "h-3": "Fixed (Passive)",
    "h-4": "Unlimited (Passive)",
    "0-1": "  * Memberships\n  * Utility tokens (API Keys) ",
    "0-2": "  * Tickets\n  * Appointment ",
    "1-2": "  * Identity\n  * Arline Tickets\n  * Entry access\n  * Prescriptions\n  * Government services ",
    "0-3": "  * Securities\n  * Equity\n  * Currencies ",
    "0-4": "  * Commodities ",
    "1-4": "  * Arline Miles\n  * Award points\n  * Record "
  },

[block:api-header]
{
  "title": "Non-Fungible vs Fungible Token Examples"
}
[/block]
We also looked at Fungibility considerations (whether your tokens are individually unique or indistinguishable from one another). Below are some examples of both fungible and non-fungible assets.
[block:parameters]
{
  "data": {
    "0-0": "Transferrable",
    "1-0": "Non-Transferable",
    "h-1": "Identical",
    "h-2": "Unique",
    "0-1": "  * Poker Chips\n  * Discount Codes\n  * Cash\n  * Bus Ticket\n  * Coupons\n  * Gift Cards\n  * Bitcoin (without blacklisting)\n  * Commodity (rice, oil, gold) ",
    "0-2": "  * Utility Tokens\n  * Lottery Tickets\n  * Ownership of car\n  * House key\n  * Title Deed ",
    "1-1": "  * Gym membership?\n  * Plane Ticket?\n  * App with associated account? ",
    "1-2": "  * Divers license\n  * University Certificate\n  * Prescription\n  * Password\n  * Identity "
  },
  "cols": 3,
  "rows": 2

**Proof of CO2 emission reduction**: riding a bike, walking, public transportation instead of using a car.

**Proof of energy consumption reduction**: incentivizing users with a token every time prove that they used less energy.
**Proof of tree planted, recycling, etc.**: Proof of undertaking actions to help natural resources.

All this to say, there are many directions you can go in creating a token. If you have specific questions and want to ask advice head over to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and ask a question, someone from the community or the foundation will help you navigate your design decisions.
