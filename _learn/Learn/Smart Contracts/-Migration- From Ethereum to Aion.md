title: "[Migration] From Ethereum to Aion"
excerpt: ""

Before getting started, you should have working knowledge of Solidity language and basics of using the Solidity compiler. If not, you can get familiar with the [Solidity Documentation v4.15.](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.15/)

The table below shows a list of core differences between ETHEREUM and AION that must be taken note of when Migrating already implemented Smart contracts from the Ethereum network to the Aion network.

**Differences**
1. Updated *uint256* to *uint128*
2. *view* not supported & removed

  "title": "ABI Differences"
}

Its necessary for you to use the **Aion Official Web3 API or Java API Library** because the ABI encoding has been reformed to align with the Virtual machine(VM) changes. For example, integer array `[1,2]` is encoded as


Ethereum uses the [*EVM*](https://bitcoinexchangeguide.com/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm-top-9-things-you-should-know-about/) to compile smart contracts, while Aion uses a more optimized implementation of the *EVM*, coined [*FastVM*](https://github.com/aionnetwork/aion_fastvm/wiki). 

You can compile it using the [Aion Official Web3 API](https://github.com/aionnetwork/aion_web3),  [Java API Library](https://github.com/aionnetwork/aion_api), [FastVM](https://github.com/aionnetwork/aion_fastvm/wiki/Compile-Smart-Contract) (only compatible with Ubuntu 16.04)

Code snippets below show the outputs when you encode the integer array `[1,2]`
