Faucet is where you can acquire your Testnet <<glossary:AION Coins>>. These coins are for development purposes on the blockchain network - meaning you can't use these on our Mainnet chain.

You'll need some balance of AION if you wish to deploy and interact with smart contracts on AION, testing infrastructure tools, or playing around with DApps. This is useful such that experimentation with development or testing purposes are costly :money-with-wings:. 
* Deploy Smart Contracts on the [Testnet Chain](https://mastery.aion.network/#/dashboard)
* Testing Infrastructure Tools
* Interact with DApps in development
* Free & Easy :money-with-wings:
