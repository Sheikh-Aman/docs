}
[/block]
AIWA is a browser wallet for Aion that allows you to store AION or ATS tokens. It allows you to interact with distributed apps on Aion without running an Aion node. DApps can be authorized to perform transactions without being exposed to your private keys or seed words.

  "title": "Why use it?"
}
[/block]
* Simple browser plugin (Chrome Extension)
* Send transactions to other addresses natively in the app
* Injects Aion Web3 into your browser, providing functions that websites can use to read and write requests to the Aion Network (seamless DApp integration)
* Allows users to specify which Aion Node they want to connect to (Testnet or Mainnet)
* Secure - stores your account information in a vault which is encrypted using a password you choose
* Easy to use, convenient, intuitive interface

  "body": "A **wallet** is an object that can be used to store AION or ATS tokens. A wallet corresponds to either a private key or a seed phrase.\n\nA **vault** is a single file that contains your AIWA-generated seed phrase, as well as any imported seed phrases or private keys. It is proprietary to AIWA at this time, but it does provide the easiest way to transfer your AIWA data to another instance of Chrome."
