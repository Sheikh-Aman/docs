Aion Dashboard is an open source blockchain explorer for the Aion Network. It is a tool for the community to access the information on the Aion blockchain and acts as a facilitator of trust and transparency. 

Aion Dashboard makes it easy for a community member to view, validate and confirm transactions on the Aion Network along with support for contracts, tokens, and high-level network statistics through an easy to use mobile-friendly browser application. Aion Dashboard is **not** a wallet and doesn't have control over the transactions and other activities on the network.
