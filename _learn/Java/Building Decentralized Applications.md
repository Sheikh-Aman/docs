  "body": "<<glossary:Aion>> is a platform that allows developers write and deploy <<glossary:smart contract>>s, which are essentially programs that run on the blockchain. A decentralized application is much like a standard web application whose \"APIs\" (or a subset of APIs) have been replaced with a smart contract. [Cryptokitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/) for example, is a centralized website that is powered by multiple smart contracts with distinct API functions: (1) ownership, (2) sales auction, (3) siring auction, and (4) gene science."
