Mining helps to secure and validate transactions on the Aion Network. Put your graphics cards to use and be rewarded with <<glossary:AION coins>> every time you successfully mine a block and add it to the blockchain.

The easiest way to start is **[WinMiner](https://www.winminer.com/#home)** 

Or if you have the equipment set up you can join a **[mining pool.](https://forum.aion.network/t/aion-community-mining-guides/782/39)**   

And for the purists out there, it is still possible to solo mine. Get started using the guides available on the  **[Aion Forum.](https://forum.aion.network/t/aion-community-mining-guides/782/3)**

Build it and they will come!

But first you need the tools to build. 

This is one of the major pain points of the space in general. People are trying to develop Dapps on the scale of Netflix on a network that is like the internet in the 90’s, it can only send email.

We need you, to build the tools and infrastructure necessary to empower Dapp developers. 

Things like scalable access to the Aion Network [(Infura)](https://infura.io/), Integrated Developer Environments [(Titan Suite)](https://titan-suite.com/), Block Explorers, Wallets, Mining Software (Smartminer, [EWBF](https://forum.aion.network/t/ewbf-aion-miner-released/1689)) and many other critical pieces of Infrastructure that haven’t been thought up yet.

Each of these Items is an opportunity to create a thriving and sustainable business in the decentralised world.

No project is too small, for example in August one of the forum users developed a tool for analyzing your [mining history](https://forum.aion.network/t/tools-to-monitor-mining-and-blockchain-data/1932) which wasn’t possible before.
