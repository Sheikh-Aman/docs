Learn to build a fun, decentralized application on the Aion Network. If you want to know more on how this demo dApp came to be, read the <a href="https://medium.com/@kimcodeashian/aion-demo-dapp-roulette-884ade64ce2d" target="_blank">blog post!</a> 

Before we dive in, let's get a sneak peak of what you're going build! :hammer: 
**Pet Roulette** is a game of luck and it is built on top of the Aion Network. 

*The rules are*: 
* 7 accounts choose an animal to win the round
* Each account can place one bet per round
* Bets must be within 1 and 100 AION

Try your luck & place your bets!! üòâüí∏üêò

## 2.1 SafeMath
**Practice Safe Math!** :wink: 

What *is* it? **SafeMath **is a Solidity math library especially designed to support safe math operations. *Safe* means that it prevents overflow when working with `uint`. 

* `using SafeMath for uint;` - lets the contract know that we'll be using the SafeMath library for `uint` variables :1234: 

Open up the Casino.sol file (found in `/contracts/Casino.sol`). You should see the SafeMath library and an empty Casino contract. 
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "pragma solidity 0.4.15;\n\nlibrary SafeMath {\n  function mul(uint _a, uint _b) internal constant returns (uint c)\n  { if (_a == 0) {\n     return 0;\n  }\n    c = _a * _b;\n    require(c / _a == _b);\n    return c;\n  }\n  function div(uint _a, uint _b) internal constant returns (uint){\n    require(_b > 0);\n    return _a / _b;\n  }\n  function sub(uint _a, uint _b) internal constant returns (uint){\n    require(_b <= _a);\n    return _a - _b;\n  }\n  function add(uint _a, uint _b) internal constant returns (uint c){\n    c = _a + _b;\n    require(c >= _a);\n    return c;\n  }\n}\n\ncontract Casino {\n  using SafeMath for uint;\n  \n}\n",
      "language": "javascript",
      "name": "Casino.sol"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
## 2.2 Basic Functionality
Let's lay down the basic functionalities of this contract.

[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "contract Casino {\n  using SafeMath for uint;\n  address owner;\n  \n  // Constructor\n  function Casino() public {\n    owner = msg.sender;\n  }\n  \n  // Make sure contract has balance > maximumBet so\n  // distributePrizes() will be able to execute without failure\n  function() public payable {}\n  \n  // refund all tokens back to owner\n  function refund() public onlyOwner {\n    uint totalBalance = this.balance;\n    owner.transfer(totalBalance);\n  }\n  \n  function kill() public {\n    if(msg.sender == owner) selfdestruct(owner);\n  }\n}",
      "language": "javascript",
      "name": "Casino.sol"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
* `Casino()` - The constructor function. On deployment of the smart contract, it'll store the creator as owner of the smart contract. Which is stored in `address public owner`
* `payable()` - Allows any AION amount send to be stored in the contract üí∏
* `kill()`‚Ää- Destroy the smart contract if there's any vulnerability or hack. It'll refund any remaining AION balance back to the owner üí£

## 2.3 Variables
Now, let's create variables for the things we have to keep track of. Inline comments are provided to explain what each line is responsible for.
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "contract Casino {\n  using SafeMath for uint;\n  address owner;\n  \n  // The minimum bet a user has to make to participate in the game\n  uint public minimumBet = 1; // Equal to 1.00 AION\n  \n  // The maximum bet a user has to make to participate in the game\n  uint public maximumBet = 100; // Equal to 100 AION\n  \n  // The total number of bets the users have made\n  uint public numberOfBets;\n  \n  // The maximum amount of bets can be made for each game\n  uint public maxAmountOfBets = 7;\n  \n  // The total amount of AION bet for this current game\n  uint public totalBet;\n  \n  // The total amount of AION paid out (contract paid out)\n  uint public totalPaid;\n  \n  // The number / animal that won the last game\n  uint public lastLuckyAnimal;\n  \n  // The current round number\n  uint public numberRound;\n  \n  // Array of players in each round\n  address[] public players;\n  \n  // Player object\n  struct Player {\n    uint amountBet;\n    uint numberSelected;\n  }\n  \n  // The address of the player and => the user info\n  mapping(address => Player) public playerInfo;\n  \n  // Events that get logged in the blockchain\n  event AnimalChosen(uint value);\n  event WinnerTransfer(address to, uint value);\n  \n  // Modifier: Only allow the execution of functions when bets are completed\n  modifier onEndGame(){\n    if(numberOfBets >= maxAmountOfBets) _;\n  }\n  modifier onlyOwner() {\n    require(msg.sender == owner);\n    _;\n  }\n  \n  function Casino() public {\n    owner = msg.sender;\n  }\n  \n  function() public payable {}\n  \n  function refund() public onlyOwner {\n    uint totalBalance = this.balance;\n    owner.transfer(totalBalance);\n  }\n  \n  function kill() public {\n    if(msg.sender == owner) selfdestruct(owner);\n  }\n}",
      "language": "javascript",
      "name": "Casino.sol"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
These are all the **variables** we'll need to successfully track the game. 

**Events ** will be emitted on the blockchain when certain functions have executed (and can be read in the transaction receipts on the <a href="https://mastery.aion.network" target="_blank">Dashboard</a>). That way we can keep track of which Animal was chosen, and the winners' accounts and their winning portions. Read more about it under the [How to Read Transactions](#section-6-how-to-read-transactions) section. 

## 2.4 Functions
Let's recall the logic and functionality of the game:
1. [`checkPlayerExists()` - Only one account can place a bet per round](#section-1-check-if-account-has-already-placed-a-bet)
2. [`bet()` - Place a bet - pick an animal & bet amount (animals are mapped from 1-10)](#section-2-player-places-a-bet-on-an-animal)
3. [`generateNumberWinner()` - Generate random winning animal (random number)](#section-3-generate-winning-animal)
4. [`distributePrizes()` - Identify & send AION to the winners' addresses](#section-4-distribute-aion-to-winners)

[block:callout]
{
  "type": "info",
  "body": "* Add the following functions inside the **Casino** contract code.\n* Inline comments & descriptions are provided."
}
[/block]
### 1.  Check if account has already placed a bet
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "function checkPlayerExists(address player) public constant returns (bool){\n    for(uint i = 0; i < players.length; i++){\n       if(players[i] == player) return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n  }",
      "language": "javascript",
      "name": "Casino.sol"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
### 2. Player places a bet on an animal
* Allow a player to place a bet
* Stores the player address, the number they chose, AION amount betted
* Updates relevant variables (player array, total betting pool, bets placed etc..)
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "function bet(uint numberSelected) payable {\n  // Check that the max amount of bets hasn't been met yet\n  require(numberOfBets <= maxAmountOfBets);\n  \n  // Check that the number to bet is within the range\n  require(numberSelected >= 1 && numberSelected <= 10);\n  \n  // Check that the player doesn't exists\n  require(checkPlayerExists(msg.sender) == false);\n  \n  // Check that the amount paid is bigger or equal the minimum bet\n  require(msg.value >= minimumBet);\n  \t\n  // Store player's address, bet amount, and animal chose\n  playerInfo[msg.sender].amountBet = msg.value;\n  playerInfo[msg.sender].numberSelected = numberSelected;\n  \t\n  numberOfBets++; // Increase number of bets placed\n  players.push(msg.sender); // Add player into array \n  totalBet += msg.value; // Increase total AION prize pool \n  \n  // Check if the round is completed, if so - draw the winning animal \n  if(numberOfBets >= maxAmountOfBets) generateNumberWinner(); \n }",
      "language": "javascript",
      "name": "Casino.sol"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
### 3. Generate winning animal
* We do this by generating a number from 1-10 that are mapped to the animals respectively

[block:callout]
{
  "type": "warning",
  "body": "This is **NOT** a secure random number generator method."
}
[/block]

      "language": "javascript",
      "name": "Casino.sol"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
### 4. Distribute AION to winners
* Store winning players in an array
* Proportion their winnings based on their bet amount (by dividing the winner bet pool)
* Distribute AION to winner accounts found in the array we created
* Reset/Update relevant variables (players, number, round, total bets, etc) 
[block:code]

Now it's time to make sure our code ***compiles*** and ***deploys*** our smart contract deploys. We'll be using <a href="https://titan-suite.com" target="_blank">Titan Suite</a> for this step. 

**Titan Suite** is a one stop shop for all your smart contract needs. Whether you want to edit, compile, or deploy your contract onto the Aion Network, it can do it all! It's both an IDE and a CLI tool but for this purpose‚Ää - ‚Ääwe'll use the IDE.¬†

What's great about the IDE is that it lints your contract for you. So, if your code isn't perfect or you missed a few things - ‚Ääit will tell you!

}
[/block]
If you're not familiar with Titan Suite, get comfortable with this [guide here.](doc:titan-suite)

      ],
      "caption": "https://ide.titan-suite.com/"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
## 3.1 Compile
1. Head over to Titan Suite's IDE and create a new file called ***Casino.sol*** and set the language to **Solidity**
2. Copy & paste the finalized ***Casino.sol*** contract into the IDE
3. [Compile your contract](doc:titan-suite#section-compile-a-contract) - You will need to enter your **Nodesmith API Endpoint** as the *Provider Address*
4. Once your contract has successfully compiled. Copy the **ABI** of the contract. You can do so by clicking the clipboard icon beside the 'Details' button. Go back into your text editor and paste the ABI in the ***Casino.json*** file. We'll be using the **ABI **to interact with our contract on the client-side of our application.

[block:callout]
{
  "type": "info",
  "body": "**ABI** -  A list of the contract's functions and arguments (in JSON format). An account wishing to use a smart contract's function uses the ABI to hash the function definition so it can create the FastVM bytecode required to call the function."
}
[/block]
## 3.2 Deployment

Deploy your contract in [3 easy steps](doc:titan-suite#section-deploy-a-contract)!

1. Navigate to the ***Accounts*** tab and [create/import an account](doc:titan-suite#section-account-management). You'll need to have some AION balance in order to deploy the contract.
2. Go to the ***Run*** tab and fill in the necessary information (*Provider Address, Account*)
3. In the dropdown list, select the **Casino** contract & click **'Deploy'** 
[block:callout]
{
  "type": "success",
  "title": "Deployment Successful?",
  "body": "Awesome! Remember to **copy the contract address**! We'll need it later to instantiate the contract on the client-side! \n\nYou can find it in the transaction receipt in the console portion of the IDE."
}
[/block]
## 3.3 Deposit AION to Contract 
Remember the `payable()` function we added to our smart contract? This function allows the contract to receive AION. 

The winning payout logic and flow of the smart contract goes a little something like this.

[block:callout]
{
  "type": "info",
  "title": "When the last player successfully places their bet",
  "body": "1. A winning animal is generated\n2. Winners are identified and payouts occur"
}
[/block]
This is executed inside of **one** transaction. Because of this, the contract balance is not updated until **after** the transaction has been sealed. Essentially, the contract would try to payout a balance it **does not** have (according to the blockchain), and thus the transaction would ***revert*** or ***fail***. 

To avoid this, we have to deposit the maximum bet amount *(under the assumption that the last better placed a bet with the max amount)*, so that the contract already carries the balance in order to carry through the transaction.

You can do this by going to your AIWA (or whatever Aion wallet you use) and 
1. Send the **maximum bet amount** *(in this case it's 100 AION)*
2. To your **contract address**

Now your contract is all locked & loaded! üî´

Basic structure: 
* Import necessary libraries, data (*React*, *Reactdom*, *aion-web3*, *Casino.json*)
* Initialize global variables for *AIWA*, *web3*, *contract instance*, and *contract address*. 
* **Enter your contract address in line 11**
* App constructor with state variables pre-defined, corresponding to the contract variables (we'll update these when we connect with the contract)
* `render()` - Responsible for updating the DOM of our app. As our state (variables) updates, the application will update and the web browser will re-render accordingly

{
  "type": "info",
  "body": "If you'd like to see the bare application before we fill in the code:\n1. In your terminal (in the project directory)\n2. Run the local server with this command ```http-server```\n3. Go to `http://localhost:8080/`"
}
[/block]
### Functions
We'll be filling out these necessary functions to get our dApp up and running! :runner: 
1. `window.onload()` - Detect if the browser has AIWA
2. `initializeContract()` - Intialize the Contract
3. `updateState()` - Update the Application State
4. `voteNumber()` - Allow users to place their bets 

## 4.1 Detect for AIWA :eyes: 
What is <a href="https://getaiwa.com" target="_blank">AIWA</a>? AIWA stands for Aion Wallet and it is pretty straightforward to use. If you're familiar with MetaMask, the developer experience is quite similar. A neat feature is that it will auto-inject a Web3 API connection to Aion.

When the browser loads, first thing we have to do is to check if the user has AIWA installed. Update the `window.onload()` function. 
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "// On load, inject AIWA\nwindow.onload = () => {\n  if (aionweb3){\n    aiwa = aionweb3;\n    aiwaInjected = true\n    console.log(\"‚úì AIWA injected successfully\");\n  }\n}",
      "language": "javascript",
      "name": "index.js"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
## 4.2 Initialize the Contract

This is where our handy ABI comes in üòâ! Remember, we imported it from our Casino.json file?

* You'll need your Nodesmith API endpoint
* If AIWA is not detected - we'll be using Nodesmith as our fallback connection. This way, the contract information can still be displayed! Although, If the user doesn't have AIWA, they will not be able to place bets üò¢.
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "initializeContract() {\n  \n  if (!aiwaInjected) {\n    // Fallback Nodesmith Connection\n    web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider(\"https://api.nodesmith.io/v1/aion/testnet/jsonrpc?apiKey=ENTERYOURAPIKEYHERE\"));\n\n    // Contract Instance\n    myContract = new web3.eth.Contract(casinoJSON.info.abiDefinition, contractAddress);\n    console.log('Contract Instantiated:', myContract);\n  \n  } else {\n    // Contract Instance w/ AIWA\n    myContract = new aiwa.Contract(casinoJSON.info.abiDefinition, contractAddress);\n    console.log('Contract Instantiated:', myContract);\n  }\n  \n  this.updateState();     // Populate DOM w/ contract info\n  this.setupListeners();\n  setInterval(function(){ // Poll contract info every 5s\n    this.updateState()\n  }.bind(this), 5000)\n}",
      "language": "javascript",
      "name": "index.js"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
## 4.3 Update the Application State
Now that we have initialized our contract, let's go ahead and:
1. Update our state with the information stored in our contract (*minimum bet, total pool, how many bets, etc*)
2. Check if AIWA is active. If so: 
  * Update the page to reflect user's current Aion address
  * And do a quick check if the account has already placed a bet

## 4.4 Place your Bets
Player Interaction Flow: 
1. Enter a number value for amount of AION to be betted
2. Click on an animal to place the bet
  * Once clicked, AIWA should pop up and prompt the user to review the transaction and ask for sign off. 
  * `setupListeners()` is the function that listens for this click event


`voteNumber()` Logic: 
* Checks if the bet amount is in between the minimum and maximum bet value
* Initializes a transaction object (which encodes the `bet()` method in the smart contract, and relevant information that we'll need to send to the contract)
* Prompts AIWA to allow the user to review and send the transaction.¬†

If you click on **"Transaction Hash"** :bookmark-tabs: - you'll dive into a more detailed view of exactly what happens on the blockchain.

There are two types of contraction interactions:
1. **Bet Transaction** - A player places a bet on an animal
2. **Payout Transaction** - The last player of the round places a bet on an animal, which triggers the contract to generate a number from 1‚Äì10 and distribute prizes (all in 1 transaction)

Here are two screenshots that break down and translate what you see in the ***Transaction Details***.
