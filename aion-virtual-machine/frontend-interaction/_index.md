# Frontend Interaction

In order for users to interact with your blockchain application, they will need some kind of interface. This section deals with how to connect your Java contract to a browser using the Aion Web3.js framework. You can find the raw API information for Web3.js in the [APIs Web3.js](apis/web3-js) section.

## Web3.js

Web3.js is a JavaScript framework that was originally created by the Ethereum Foundation for the Ethereum network. It was released on GitHub as open-source software. Aion took this framework and modified it to fix the Aion Virtual Machine. Because of this, there are some differences between how Ethereum developers deal with Web3.js and how Aion developers should deal with Web3.js.
