# Remote Kernel

Manage your contracts and accounts on a remote node from within IntelliJ.

Before you can perform any remote actions, you need to have completed the [Remote Kernel configuration options](/aion-virtual-machine/intellij/configure#remote-kernel).

## Deploy

Deploy your contract to the Testnet (Mastery).

Run this command by right clicking anywhere on the contract and selecting **Aion Virtual Machine** > **Remote** > **Deploy**. You will be prompted to enter a [node URL](/aion-virtual-machine/intellij/configure#remote-kernel) and [deployer address](/aion-virtual-machine/intellij/configure#remote-kernel) if you haven't filled them in already.

This command will compile your contract before attempting to deploy, unless you have specified that you do not want this to happen in the [configuration options](/aion-virtual-machine/intellij/configure#remote-kernel).
