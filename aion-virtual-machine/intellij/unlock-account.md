# Unlock Account

Unlock an account on a remote node.

Run this command by right clicking anywhere within a contract and selecting **Aion Virtual Machine** > **Remote** > **Unlock Account**.

This allows you to use the specified account to deploy, call, and interact with contracts. This is not advised on public / shared nodes. Some hosting services disable the unlocking of account on their shared nodes.
