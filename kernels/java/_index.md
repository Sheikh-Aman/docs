# Java Kernel

The Java implementation of the Aion kernel is the original implementation. Learn how to install and configure it here.

## Quickstart

If you want to get up and running quickly, download the latest [Aion Java kernel `.tar.bz2` file from Github](https://github.com/aionnetwork/aion/releases) and follow the [Install the Kernel](install-the-kernel) section.

## Brief Overview

Aion has lots of different aspects and products, and everything can get a bit confusing. If you think of the Aion network like a train, the kernel is the engine. It's the thing that does all the hard work, computing all the processes, and pulling the rest of the network along.

Things like the Aion Virtual Machine, local nodes, and third-party hosting services all use the Aion kernel. They are just different methods of hosting the same thing. The [Aion White Papers](https://aion.network/developers/#whitepapers) provide a deeper look into what the kernel is and how it works.

This section of the docs goes over how to configure and interact with the kernel directly. If you're looking to develop the Aion kernel itself, or mine on Aion, then this section is for you! If you're just looking to create some Dapps, then you can leave this section for now.

## Aion Kernel Development

If you want to get involved with the Aion Java kernel development, take a look at the [Githut repository](https://github.com/aionnetwork/aion/).

## Miners

If you're interested in mining on the Aion networks, refer to the [Mining](/extra/mining) section.
