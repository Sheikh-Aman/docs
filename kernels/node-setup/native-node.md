# Native Node

Native nodes run on your local machine or server. You can either run one of the [precompiled packages](#section-precompiled-packages), or [build your own](#section-build-your-own)

Make sure you're running **Ubuntu 16.04 or higher**. Currently we cannot support all Unix, however, it may be possible to run the kernel on other Linux distributions. Sadly the kernel will not work on a Mac. Take a look at the [community made Docker image](https://github.com/bloxbean/aion-fastvm-docker) if you want to test things out on other systems.
