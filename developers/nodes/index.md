title: Nodes
description: Nodes are the computers that handle transactions on the Aion network. All the transactions that Dapps make go through nodes. They can be run locally on your computer, virtualize in a virtual machine, or you can connect to a remote node from a hosting service.

A node is a computer that is connected to a network. In our case, each node is running the Aion kernel. Each node talks to other nodes on the network to do things like run applications, or confirm transactions. Unlike other networks, we have implemented the Aion virtual machine (AVM) on both the Java and Rust kernels. Operationally both these kernels function the same way and react identically when queried by the network. The purpose of having two kernels is for redundancy. If one of the kernels is compromised, the other kernel is able to take the weight and keep the network alive.

Choosing which kernel you want to spin up is down to personal preference. There's no functional difference between the two.

## What Nodes Do

The following information was taken from [WorldCryptoIndex.com](https://www.worldcryptoindex.com/how-nodes-work/)

The purpose of nodes is to preserve the integrity of the blockchain for a particular cryptocurrency. An entire blockchain history can be preserved even if there is just one node running it, anywhere in the world. This makes cryptocurrencies that run on blockchains extremely resilient to things like hacks, power failures, or systemic crashes.

Despite the fact that it only takes one node to preserve a blockchain transaction history, blockchain-based cryptocurrencies typically have hundreds, thousands or even tens of thousands of nodes running at any given time. The more nodes that there are for a cryptocurrency, the safer that cryptocurrency is.

It is highly unlikely that a mega-catastrophe could threaten the integrity of the Bitcoin blockchain. Though extremely unlikely, it is still theoretically possible. For example, the only real way that the Bitcoin blockchain would be taken down would be if something like a nuclear war occurred, or if electromagnetic pulses were detonated in many different urban and suburban areas at the same time. But all it takes is one computer running a full node to upload a blockchain and get things running again.

Nodes essentially make it impossible for governments, terrorists, or any other group of people to completely shut down a blockchain and erase it. When there are thousands of copies of a blockchain scattered all across the world, trying to delete every single copy is basically pointless; it cannot be done.

## Full Nodes and Mining

People who run full nodes typically do not get paid to do so. They simply run the full node because it helps the cryptocurrency preserve its blockchain, and to keep the ledger distributed. Many people who run full nodes are just cryptocurrency enthusiasts who want to make sure that cryptocurrencies run correctly.

Mining is similar to running a full node, however, people who mine Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies get paid to do this. The difference between running a full node and mining cryptocurrencies is that miners validate cryptocurrency transactions using advanced computing power, and create “blocks” for the blockchain. Blocks are just groups of transactions that have all been validated. Miners are rewarded in the form of receiving cryptocurrency payments for the services they provide. They can either be given new cryptocurrency units or be paid transaction fees by the people making the transactions.

Mining can be very profitable for people who are tech-savvy and who have the right equipment and knowledge. Miners typically run full nodes as a part of their mining setups. So, miners often partake in both mining and running nodes. Not all people who run full nodes also mine.
