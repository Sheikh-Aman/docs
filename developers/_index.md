This space is for developers to get their hand dity working on the Aion network. These pages contain code example, api references, and workflow tutorials for the various parts of the ecosystem. [Not a developer?](/) This place might not be what you're looking for. If you want to find some general guidence or where to start adding blockchain modules into your application, checkout the [general start guide](/).

## New to Blockchain

If you're new to blockchain developer, then you should checkout the [Fundamentals](fundamentals) section. It contains information on how to properly structure your smart contracts, suggested workflows, and certain caveats that you should be aware of.

## Testing and Debugging

One of the major benefits of building on the Aion network is the ability to [test and debug](testing-and-debugging) you contracts, without having to deploy them to a public network. This feature is available straight out of the box, and can speed up application development. The testing and debugging features are available for any development environment, and is an absolute must for any projects following a test-driven-development workflow.

## Create a Node

All transaction on public Aion networks must go through an Aion node. Learn about the [different nodes available](nodes), and how to setup you own. You can also find information on connecting to a node hosting service, enabling you to start developing blockchain applications much faster.
