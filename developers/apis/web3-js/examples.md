title: Web3.js
description: We've put together a few examples on how you can use Aion Web3.js in your projects. All these examples use the minified Javascript file instead of the Node JS console. This is so you can copy and paste in the code examples into a boilerplate project.

## Bolierplate Project

We've put together a _boilerplate_ project that you can use to quickly start playing around with the examples listed here. To set this project up:

1. Download the [`project.zip` file](/developers/apis/web3-js/project-assets/aion-web3-boilerplate-examples.zip).
2. Unzip the package somewhere.
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `serve` to start a local mini-server.
5. Go to [localhost:1313](//localhost:5000) to view the site.

The only package that is installed by NPM is the `serve` package. It sets up a local mini-server that allows you to interact with Aion Web3.js properly without having to spin up an entire server or virtual machine on your computer. You can find out more about Serve on Zeit's [Github repository](https://github.com/zeit/serve).
