Run this command by right clicking anywhere within a contract and selecting **Aion Virtual Machine** > **Remote** > **Transfer**.

The **Enter transfer information** window asks you to provide a **From Account** address and **Password**, or a **Private Key**. The **To Account** field is mandatory and takes a valid Aion address. The **Amount (in nAMP)** field is mandatory and take the amount you want to send. This amount should be input as `AMP` (`1 AION` = `1000000000000000000 nAMP`). **NRG** and **NRG Price** and prefilled and can be left with their default values.
